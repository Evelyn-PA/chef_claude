## ✨ Overview
This project was built as part of my self-study to explore **AI integration** and improve my front-end skills. It demonstrates how modern web apps can leverage APIs (in this case, Google Gemini) to create dynamic, useful tools.

As a student web developer, I’m passionate about building applications that make everyday tasks easier and more fun. I’m currently seeking **front-end/web development internship opportunities** and would love to bring this same energy and creativity to a team.
